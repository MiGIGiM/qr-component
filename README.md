## My process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this solution I learned about how to use CSS variables and realize how good of a tool they are when working with colors or sizes since they make changes easier to do. Also I learned how to center a `div` tag without the need of flexbox.

### Continued development

I'm not sure how to properly set source from images using the relative path and I definitely think that is a point of improvement because at the moment I'm just consuming an online image hosting services, [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/).
